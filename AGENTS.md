# Repository Guidelines

Do not write to a super file!!!! Do not write to a super file!!!! Do not write to a super file!!!!
All actual build and test commands must be executed within the GitHub workflow; running them on your local machine is prohibited—local device performance is insufficient.

Do not execute any installation commands; simply modify the code.

Regarding the garbled text issue you mentioned, it has been confirmed that it is not caused by file corruption. The file can be read correctly in PowerShell using the following method:
powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Get-Content -Encoding UTF8 file-path
Each time you complete the addition or modification of a feature according to my requirements, a commit message should be automatically generated and submitted after you finish modifying the code. When submitting a GPG key, you can temporarily omit the signature.auto push

apply_patch 在当前环境可用。

  原因
  之前失败是因为 patch 头写成了：

  *** Begin Patch ***

  正确格式必须是：

  *** Begin Patch
  ...
  *** End Patch

  末尾不能多写 ***。工具只认精确的 *** Begin Patch 作为第一行。
